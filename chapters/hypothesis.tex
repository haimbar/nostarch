\chapter{Hypothesis Testing}
\label{ch:hypothesis}

Life is full of decisions where we don’t know the truth but still need
to act. Is that coin you’re flipping really fair, or does your sneaky
friend always seem to win the toss? Should you trust that online
review saying pineapple pizza is amazing, or was it written by someone
with questionable taste? In situations like these, we’re left making
judgments without ever being 100\% sure of the answer. Hypothesis
testing is the scientific version of this everyday decision-making
process. It’s not about proving something beyond all doubt; it’s about
weighing the evidence and making the best call with the information at
hand---like a courtroom verdict, but with fewer objections and more
statistics.


\section{Basic Concepts}

Hypothesis testing formalizes how we handle uncertainty in data-driven
decisions. In practice, we ask questions like: Is a new drug effective
in treating a disease, or is it no better
than the current standard? Is one commercial more effective than another 
in driving sales on a website (a process often referred to as an A-B test)? 
Can the observed increase in global mean temperature be attributed to human 
activities? Or, is the 30-day hospital readmission rate higher among minority 
patients compared to others?


At the core of hypothesis testing lies a simple setup. There are two 
competing explanations: the
\emph{null hypothesis}\index{\emph{null hypothesis}},
$H_0$, which represents
the default position or baseline assumption, and the
\emph{alternative hypothesis}\index{\emph{alternative hypothesis}},
$H_1$, which reflects a meaningful difference or effect.
In the new drug example, $H_0$ states that the drug has no effect, 
while $H_1$ claims it does. Depending on context, $H_1$ may represent
the investigator's belief, but not necessarily what they hope to 
support---sometimes the goal is to rule out harm or demonstrate
equivalence.
\hb{not always} \jy{rephrased.}


Think of hypothesis testing as a strategic game. Nature knows the
truth---whether $H_0$ or $H_1$ is correct---but keeps it hidden. Our
job is to examine the available evidence from the observed data and
decide which hypothesis to accept. This process is not
foolproof; we might reject $H_0$ when it is true
(a \emph{Type~I error}\index{\emph{Type~I error}}), or fail to 
reject $H_0$ when $H_1$ is true (a \emph{Type~II error}\index{\emph{Type~II
    error}}). Understanding and managing these risks is fundamental part
of hypothesis testing and highlights both its challenge and nuance.


\subsection{Stochastic Analog of Proof by Contradiction}

Hypothesis testing can be viewed as a stochastic analog of proof by 
contradiction \citep{reeves1980hypothesis}. In mathematics, proof by
contradiction starts by assuming
the negation of the statement we wish to prove. Logical reasoning then
leads to a contradiction, thereby establishing the original 
statement to be true. Similarly, in hypothesis testing, we start by 
assuming the null hypothesis, $H_0$, is true and assess
whether the observed data align with this assumption. If the data 
deviate from what we would expect under $H_0$ to a sufficient degree,
we reject it in favor of the alternative hypothesis, $H_1$.


Despite the shared structure--- both approaches begin with an
assumption and seek evidence that undermines it---there is a
fundamental difference. Proof by contradiction yields logical
certainty, while hypothesis testing is inherently probabilistic.
Rejecting $H_0$ does not definitively prove $H_1$; instead, 
it means the evidence against $H_0$ exceeds a pre-specified threshold
to favor $H_1$. Similarly, failing to reject $H_0$ does not confirm
its validity, only that the data do not provide sufficient grounds for 
rejection.


% Misconception \citep{falk1995significance}. 

\subsection{Type~I and Type~II Errors}

The probabilistic nature of hypothesis testing introduces two types of 
decision errors. A \emph{Type~I error}\index{\emph{Type~I error}}
occurs when we reject the null hypothesis, $H_0$, even though it is
true. This is often referred to as false positive, the incorrect
conclusion that an effect exists when it actually does not.
The probability of making this error is called the \emph{significance
  level}\index{\emph{significance level}}, denoted by $\alpha$. A smaller $\alpha$ 
reduces this risk but may make it harder to detect real effects.
A \emph{Type~II error}\index{\emph{Type~II error}} arises when we fail to
reject $H_0$ even though it is false. This is often referred to as
false negative error, reflecting the risk of missing a true effect,
with its probability denoted by $\beta$. The quantity $1 - \beta$,
called the \emph{power}\index{\emph{power}} of the test, masures the test's
ability to detect an effect when one truly exists.


\begin{example}[Lady testing tea]
R. A. Fisher's ``Lady Tasting Tea'' experiment, described in his 1935 
book \emph{The Design of Experiments}, became one of the earliest and 
most elegant demonstrations of formal hypothesis testing 
\citep{salsburg2002lady}. Fisher recounted an event at Rothamsted 
Experimental Station, where a colleague claimed she could tell by 
taste whether milk or tea had been poured first into a cup. To test 
this claim, Fisher designed an experiment involving eight cups of tea: 
four prepared with milk poured first, and four with tea poured first. 
The cups were presented in random order, and the lady was told that 
there were four of each kind. Her task was to identify the four cups 
with milk poured first. Assuming the null hypothesis, $H_0$, that she 
was guessing, Fisher calculated the probability of her achieving a 
result as good as the observed one purely by chance.


If her performance was highly unlikely under $H_0$, the null hypothesis 
would be rejected in favor of the alternative, $H_1$, suggesting she 
may truly have the claimed ability. This decision, however, carried the 
risk of a Type~I error---concluding she had the ability when she did 
not. Conversely, failing to reject $H_0$ could result in a Type~II 
error---overlooking a genuine ability due to insufficient evidence. The 
experiment highlighted how statistical decisions are made under 
uncertainty and how error probabilities---Type~I and Type~II---must be 
considered in the design and interpretation of hypothesis tests.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{The Test Statistic and the p-Value}


In hypothesis testing, a \emph{test statistic}\index{\emph{test statistic}} 
is a numerical summary of the data used to evaluate the null hypothesis, 
$H_0$. It captures the relevant aspects of the observed data under 
$H_0$ and quantifies the evidence against it. The choice of test 
statistic depends on the specific hypothesis and the structure of the 
data. A test rejects $H_0$ if its test statistic, denoted by $T$, 
falls into a designated \emph{rejection region}\index{\emph{rejection region}}. 
The probability that $T$ falls in this region when $H_0$ is true is 
called the \emph{significance level}, typically denoted by $\alpha$. 
This threshold is usually chosen to be small, such as 0.05 or 0.01, 
to limit the chance of making a Type~I error.


The \emph{p-value} provides an alternative way to summarize results. 
It is defined as the probability, under $H_0$, of obtaining a test 
statistic as extreme as or more extreme than the observed one. A small 
p-value indicates that the observed result would be rare under $H_0$, 
thus providing evidence against it. The decision rule is simple: 
if the p-value is less than $\alpha$, we reject $H_0$; otherwise, we 
fail to reject it. This offers flexibility, as the same p-value can 
be compared against different significance levels depending on
context.


The p-value is often misunderstood as the probability that $H_0$ is 
true given the data. This is incorrect. The p-value assumes that 
$H_0$ is true and measures how surprising the observed data are under 
that assumption. As shown in empirical studies, this misinterpretation 
is widespread, even among statistically trained researchers 
\citep{falk1995significance}. Understanding that the p-value reflects 
compatibility between the data and the null model---not the truth of 
the hypothesis---is essential for proper statistical reasoning.


\begin{example}[Lady tasting tea (continued)]

In the Lady Tasting Tea experiment, the test statistic $T$ is the 
number of cups the lady correctly identifies as having been prepared 
with milk poured first. The total number of cups is an even number $n$, 
with exactly $n/2$ prepared milk-first and $n/2$ tea-first. Importantly, 
the lady is told in advance that there are exactly $n/2$ of each type, 
and she is required to label exactly $n/2$ cups as milk-first. Under the 
null hypothesis $H_0$, she is assumed to be guessing. In this setup, 
it can be shown that the distribution of $T$ under $H_0$ follows a 
\emph{hypergeometric distribution}\index{distribution!\emph{hypergeometric}}, 
and large values of $T$ provide stronger evidence against $H_0$.


To carry out the test, we fix a significance level $\alpha$, such as
$0.05$, representing the maximum tolerable probability of a Type~I
error. We then define the \emph{rejection region}, consisting of
values of $T$ that are considered too extreme to plausibly occur under
$H_0$. Suppose we choose $\{n/2\}$ as the rejection region—that is, we
only reject $H_0$ if the lady achieves a perfect classification. The
probability of this outcome under $H_0$ is
$\Pr(T = n/2) = 1 / \binom{n}{n/2}$.


For example, suppose $n = 8$ and the lady correctly identifies all 
$4$ milk-first cups. The observed test statistic is 
$T_{\text{obs}} = 4$, and the p-value is 
\[
  \Pr(T \ge T_{\text{obs}} \mid H_0) = 1 / \binom{8}{4}
  = 1/70 \approx  0.0143.
\]

Since this p-value is smaller than the commonly used significance
level $\alpha = 0.05$, we would reject $H_0$ and conclude that her
performance is unlikely to be due to guessing.


Now increase the number of cups to $n = 10$, with the lady again 
achieving a perfect identification of the $5$ milk-first cups. The 
p-value is
\[
  \Pr(T \ge 5 \mid H_0) = 1 / \binom{10}{5}
  = 1 / 252 \approx 0.0040.
\]
This smaller p-value gives even stronger evidence
against~$H_0$---suggesting that her performance is highly unlikely to
be the result of chance guessing and that she may indeed have the 
ability to tell the difference.
\end{example}

\section{Permutation Tests}


Permutation tests rely on the assumption that under the null hypothesis, 
\(H_0\), the group labels (e.g., \(x_1\) and \(x_2\)) are exchangeable. 
This means that if \(H_0\) is true, the observed values in both groups 
come from the same underlying distribution, and any difference between 
groups is due to random variation.

By pooling all the data and randomly reassigning it into new groups, we 
simulate what the data might look like if \(H_0\) were true. Each 
permutation represents a potential arrangement of the data under \(H_0\), 
and the distribution of the test statistic across these permutations 
forms the \emph{sampling distribution under \(H_0\)}. Comparing the 
observed test statistic to this distribution allows us to calculate a 
p-value, which quantifies how extreme the observed result is, assuming 
\(H_0\).


The validity of permutation testing hinges on the exchangeability of 
the data under \(H_0\). If \(H_0\) is true, the data's group labels are 
arbitrary, and shuffling them does not alter their joint distribution. 
This ensures that the permutation-based sampling distribution accurately 
represents the behavior of the test statistic under \(H_0\).


For instance, in the ``Lady Tasting Tea'' experiment, the null hypothesis 
\(H_0\) assumes that the lady is guessing randomly. Under this assumption, 
all possible arrangements of the cups are equally likely, making the 
permuted sampling distribution an exact representation of \(H_0\). Similarly, 
in the example of testing for a difference in means between \(x_1\) and \(x_2\), 
the permuted sampling distribution reflects the behavior of the test 
statistic when there is no true difference between the groups.


\paragraph{Defining the Test Statistic}
To make this concrete, let us revisit the example. Suppose we have two 
groups of data, \(x_1\) and \(x_2\), with sample sizes \(n_1 = n_2 = 30\). 
If \(H_0\) is true, there is no real difference between the groups, so 
the observed difference in means, \why{This should be code instead of latex, right?} \code{mean(\(x_2\)) - mean(\(x_1\))}, 
is simply due to chance.
\showCode{R}{Code/hypo-perm.R}[4][8]


When we randomly shuffle the pooled data \code{\(x_1\) and \(x_2\)} 
and split it into new groups of size \(n_1\) and \(n_2\), the resulting 
groupings represent plausible outcomes under \(H_0\). Repeating this 
permutation many times allows us to build the sampling distribution 
of the test statistic under the assumption of no group differences.



Here, \code{xd} is the observed difference in means between \(x_1\) and 
\(x_2\). Under \(H_0\), which assumes no difference between the groups, 
any observed difference is due to random variation.

\paragraph{Generating the Sampling Distribution Under \(H_0\)}

To compute a p-value, we need the \emph{sampling distribution} of the test 
statistic under \(H_0\). Permutation testing constructs this distribution 
by repeatedly shuffling the data to simulate the null hypothesis. For a 
single permutation, we shuffle the combined data, split it into two groups, 
and compute the test statistic:
\showCode{R}{Code/hypo-perm.R}[12][14]


Each permutation represents a possible arrangement of the data under \(H_0\). 
If the total number of permutations is small, we can enumerate all possible 
arrangements to compute an exact p-value:
\showCode{R}{Code/hypo-perm.R}[19][19]


\paragraph{Approximating the p-Value via Random Permutations}

When the total number of permutations is large, as is often the case, we 
approximate the sampling distribution using a subset of random permutations.
This is implemented in the following function:
\showCode{R}{Code/hypo-perm.R}[22][33]

This function simulates \code{nperm} permutations, calculates the test 
statistic for each, and compares them to the observed test statistic to 
compute the p-value.

\begin{example}[Two-sample test based on random permutation]
Let us apply the permutation test to two samples drawn from gamma 
distributions, with a true difference (\(\delta = 10\)):
\showCode{R}{Code/hypo-perm.R}[35][38]


This outputs the p-value, which quantifies the probability of observing a 
test statistic as extreme as or more extreme than the observed statistic 
under \(H_0\).
\end{example}


Permutation tests rely on minimal assumptions, making them robust to 
non-standard data distributions. The resulting p-value provides evidence 
against \(H_0\): a smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence that the 
observed difference in means is not due to chance. By using random 
permutations, we efficiently approximate the sampling distribution when 
enumeration of all permutations is computationally infeasible.


\section{Properties of Hypothesis Tests}


\subsection{Properties of Hypothesis Tests}

Hypothesis tests are evaluated using two critical 
properties: their size, or significance level, and their 
power. These properties help us understand the reliability 
and sensitivity of a test in different scenarios.

The \emph{size} of a hypothesis test, also referred to 
as the \emph{significance level} and denoted by \(\alpha\), 
is the probability of committing a \emph{Type~I error}. A 
Type~I error occurs when the null hypothesis, \(H_0\), is 
rejected even though it is true. For instance, if \(\alpha = 0.05\), 
there is a 5\% chance of falsely rejecting \(H_0\) when it 
is true. This level is usually chosen in advance to control 
the risk of false positives, with typical values being 0.05 
or 0.01. Importantly, the size of a test depends on the 
sampling distribution of the test statistic under \(H_0\). 
Tests that control their size consistently are said to 
be valid.

The \emph{power} of a test measures its ability to detect 
a true effect when one exists. It is defined as the 
probability of correctly rejecting \(H_0\) when the 
alternative hypothesis, \(H_1\), is true. Mathematically, 
the power is \(1 - \beta\), where \(\beta\) is the probability 
of committing a \emph{Type~II error}—failing to reject \(H_0\) 
when \(H_1\) is true. Higher power indicates greater 
sensitivity of the test to detect differences or effects, 
which is desirable in most applications. The power of a 
test depends on several factors, including the sample 
size, the true effect size, the significance level \(\alpha\), 
and the variability in the data. Larger sample sizes, 
larger effect sizes, and smaller variability all contribute 
to higher power.

When two tests both maintain the same size, the one with 
higher power is preferred because it provides greater 
evidence against \(H_0\) when \(H_1\) is true. However, 
there is an inherent trade-off between size and power. 
Reducing \(\alpha\) decreases the likelihood of Type~I 
errors but may increase the likelihood of Type~II errors, 
leading to lower power. Conversely, increasing power often 
requires relaxing the significance level or increasing 
sample size, which may not always be feasible.

In the next example, we will illustrate these 
concepts by comparing two common tests for comparing two 
samples: the t-test and the Wilcoxon test. Using simulations, 
we will examine their size and power under different 
conditions and demonstrate how their performance varies.


\begin{example}{Two-sample comparison}
First, let’s see how we can perform the tests for one pair of datasets:
\showCode{R}{Code/hypo-2samp.R}[2][9]


Here, \code{x1} and \code{x2} represent two groups of data. The t-test assumes
the data are normally distributed, while the Wilcoxon test is
distribution-free, meaning it works for a wider range of data
distributions.


Next, we create a function \code{do1rep()} that simulates one
experiment. This generates two groups of data, applies both tests, and
records their p-values.
\showCode{R}{Code/hypo-2samp.R}[13][22]


Here, \code{delta} represents the true difference between the means
of the two groups. When \code{delta = 0}, there’s no real difference
(null hypothesis is true). For each test, we calculate the p-value to
assess whether to reject the null hypothesis.

To evaluate the sizes (false positive rates) of the tests, we simulate
multiple experiments where \code{delta = 0} and calculate the proportions of
times the tests reject $H_0$.
\showCode{R}{Code/hypo-2samp.R}[26][28]

The function \code{rowMeans(sim < 0.05)} calculates the fraction of
times the p-value is below 0.05, representing the rejection rate for
each test.


We wrap the simulation into a function \code{empRejRate()} to
compute rejection rates for different sample sizes, distributions, and
effect sizes:
\showCode{R}{Code/hypo-2samp.R}[32][35]

Now, we compare the performance of the t-test and Wilcoxon test for
data from different distributions (normal and Cauchy):
\showCode{R}{Code/hypo-2samp.R}[38][44]

For the Cauchy distribution, which has heavier tails than the normal
distribution, the performance of the tests may differ significantly.


Finally, we compute and plot the power of the tests as the effect size
(\code{delta}) increases:
\showCode{R}{Code/hypo-2samp.R}[47][62]

These plots show the empirical rejection rates (power) as \code{delta}
increases. For the t-test, performance depends on the assumption of
normality, while the Wilcoxon test is more robust under non-normal
distributions like the Cauchy.
