## Meeting, January 10

### General comments:
- HaiYing+Haim: find out why \inln adds a space after the output.
- Ask Jill if we can avoid breaking a function or variable at the
  end of the line.
- Choose a format for exercise environment.
- Add exercises in-place.
- In figures, use the golden ratio for the asp, unless symmetry 
  is required (like Q-Q plots).
- In figures use label sizes and point sizes that don't look too small
  after rescaling.
- Intsoduce the crash data in chapter 2, and use it in subsequent chapters.

### Specific chapter comments

- Chapter 2 - add crash data description.
- Chapter 5 - use verbal description and plots to explain notions related
  to estimation. For a biased estimator, can use min/max for the range of
  a uniform distribution. For MSE, show as histograms.
- Chapter 6 - find more survivor bias from the book Dark Data, by David Hand.
  The same book also has examples of several other types of biases which
  we can quote and cite.
  Add a conclusion, what biases to look out for, and how to avoid them.
- Chapter 7 - Jun will write the draft.
- Chapter 8 - maybe use examples from How Not to be Wrong, by Jordan
  Ellenberg (or other sources with nice examples about correlation and
  regression). Maybe this one? https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations


## previous notes:

### Conventions

- Code width - change font type so that we can show 80 characters per line
- Use consistent code style
  + space before and after each = sign, and after commas
  + Comments in R – if the whole line, use ##. Inline use #
  + other things?
- Label prefix conventions. For example: ch: eqn: tab: fig:
- Homework exercises - within sections, or end of chapter, or both?
- Latex source - use 80 characters per line
- Create figures with width that can span the text width, so that there
   is not that much white space
- Use labels to identify chunks, instead of line numbers
- Named \inlnR
- Add index terms
- Compile based on change time of files.
