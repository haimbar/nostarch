## Conventions

- Code width - change font type so that we can show 80 characters per line
- Use consistent code style
  + space before and after each = sign, and after commas
  + Comments in R – if the whole line, use ##. Inline use #
  + other things?
- Label prefix conventions. For example: ch: eqn: tab: fig:
- Homework exercises - within sections, or end of chapter, or both?
- Latex source - use 80 characters per line
- Create figures with width that can span the text width, so that there
   is not that much white space
- Use labels to identify chunks, instead of line numbers

## Add
